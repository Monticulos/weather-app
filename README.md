# weather-app

This code is a Node.js application built using the Express framework to create a web server. It serves a weather-related web application that allows users to search for weather information based on a location. Here's a breakdown of what this code does:

It imports necessary modules including Express, Axios for making HTTP requests, Body Parser for parsing form data, and 'dotenv' for managing environment variables.

It creates an Express application instance and sets it to listen on port 3000.

It defines a user agent header for making API requests to the OpenWeather and Met APIs.

It retrieves an OpenWeather API key from the environment variables.

It serves static files (like CSS and images) from a 'public' folder using Express's static middleware.

It sets up Body Parser to handle URL-encoded form data.

It defines a route for the root URL ("/") that renders an "index.ejs" template when a GET request is made to it.

It defines a route ("/weather") that handles POST requests. This route makes two API requests:

It calls the OpenWeather API to retrieve geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) based on the user's location input.
It then uses these coordinates to call the Met API to get detailed weather information.
It structures the weather data obtained from the APIs and prepares it to be sent to the front end.

It renders a "weather.ejs" template with the weather information and sends it as a response to the user's request.

If there are any errors during the API calls or data processing, it logs the error and sends an error message as a response to the user.

Finally, it starts the Express server and listens on port 3000, printing a message to the console once the server is running.

Overall, this code sets up a web server that allows users to search for weather information based on a location, fetches that data from external APIs, and displays it on a web page.
